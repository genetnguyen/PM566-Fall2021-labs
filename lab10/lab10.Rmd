# Setup
```{r}
# install.packages(c("RSQLite", "DBI"))

library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)

# Initialize a temporary in memory database
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), ":memory:")

# Download tables
actor <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/actor.csv")
rental <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/rental.csv")
customer <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/customer.csv")
payment <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/payment_p2007_01.csv")

# Copy data.frames to database
dbWriteTable(con, "actor", actor)
dbWriteTable(con, "rental", rental)
dbWriteTable(con, "customer", customer)
dbWriteTable(con, "payment", payment)
```

```{r}
dbListTables(con)
```

TIP: Use can use the following QUERY to see the structure of a table

```{r}
# PRAGMA table_info(TABLE NAME)
```
# Exercise 1

Retrive the actor ID, first name and last name for all actors using the actor table. Sort by last name and then by first name.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
  FROM actor
  ORDER by last_name, first_name
  ")
```


# Exercise 2

Retrive the actor ID, first name, and last name for actors whose last name equals ‘WILLIAMS’ or ‘DAVIS’.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
  FROM actor
  WHERE last_name IN ('WILLIAMS', 'DAVIS')
  ")
```


# Exercise 3

Write a query against the rental table that returns the IDs of the customers who rented a film on July 5, 2005 (use the rental.rental_date column, and you can use the date() function to ignore the time component). Include a single row for each distinct customer ID.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT customer_id, rental_date
  FROM rental
  WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05'
  ORDER BY rental_date
  ")
```


# Exercise 4

# Exercise 4.1

Construct a query that retrives all rows from the payment table where the amount is either 1.99, 7.99, 9.99.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT *
  FROM payment
  WHERE amount IN (1.99, 7.99, 9.99)
  ")
```


# Exercise 4.2

Construct a query that retrives all rows from the payment table where the amount is greater then 5

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT *
  FROM payment
  WHERE amount > 5
  ")
```


# Exercise 4.2

Construct a query that retrives all rows from the payment table where the amount is greater then 5 and less then 8

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT *
  FROM payment
  WHERE amount > 5 AND amount < 8
  ")
```


# Exercise 5

Retrive all the payment IDs and their amount from the customers whose last name is ‘DAVIS’.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT p.payment_id, p.amount
  FROM payment as p
  JOIN customer as c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
  WHERE c.last_name = 'DAVIS'
  ")
```


# Exercise 6

# Exercise 6.1

Use COUNT(*) to count the number of rows in rental

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM rental
  ")
```


# Exercise 6.2

Use COUNT(*) and GROUP BY to count the number of rentals for each customer_id

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as N_Rentals
  FROM rental
  GROUP BY customer_id
  ")
```


# Exercise 6.3

Repeat the previous query and sort by the count in descending order

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as N_Rentals
  FROM rental
  GROUP BY customer_id
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
  ")
```


# Exercise 6.4

Repeat the previous query but use HAVING to only keep the groups with 40 or more.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as N_Rentals
  FROM rental
  GROUP BY customer_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) >= 40
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
  ")
```


# Exercise 7

The following query calculates a number of summary statistics for the payment table using MAX, MIN, AVG and SUM

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT MAX(amount) as MaxAMT, MIN(amount) as MinAMT, AVG(amount) as AvgAMT, SUM(amount) as SumAMT
  FROM payment
  ")
```


# Exercise 7.1

Modify the above query to do those calculations for each customer_id

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT customer_id, MAX(amount) as MaxAMT, MIN(amount) as MinAMT, AVG(amount) as AvgAMT, SUM(amount) as SumAMT
  FROM payment
  GROUP BY customer_id
  ")
```


# Exercise 7.2

Modify the above query to only keep the customer_ids that have more then 5 payments

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,
  "
  SELECT customer_id, MAX(amount) as MaxAMT, MIN(amount) as MinAMT, AVG(amount) as AvgAMT, SUM(amount) as SumAMT
  FROM payment
  GROUP BY customer_id
  HAVING MAX(amount) > 5
  ")
```


# Cleanup

Run the following chunk to disconnect from the connection.

```{r}
# clean up
dbDisconnect(con)
```
